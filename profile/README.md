## Essay Guidelines

In this class you will be asked to write a number of essays.
All of these essays **must be written by you**, I want to know what you think.
Assignments marked with "Essay" will use the following requirements.

## Format

All essays in this class are to be in [APA](https://apastyle.apa.org/instructional-aids/beginner-student-paper-checklist.pdf) format.
Follow these specific requirements:

- Font: Use a standard, readable font like Times New Roman, 12-point.
- Line Spacing: The entire document must be double-spaced.
- Header: The header on each page should include your last name and the page number in the top right corner.
- Citations: You must properly cite all sources, both in-text and on a separate References page, using APA guidelines.
    - You **can** cite AI. Just know this should not be a primary source. You need to cite AI as
      well [like so](https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/how-to-cite-chatgpt).
- Length: Unless otherwise specified, all essays should be between 300 and 600 words.

## Accuracy

A lot of the papers in this class will be option based / persuasive.
I want to hear your opinion **BUT** your claims must be instanced.
Meaning if you say "AI hurts the environment because of its large energy usage." you need cite a source for that claim.
The source of this claim must be reliable.
**AI is not a reliable source.**

## Recommended Work flow

I will give some advice to writing your paper.
Spend the time planning its always worth it.
Anything with 🤖 emoji means you **can** use AI to help.
Don't let AI slop up your paper.

1. Open your word processor and copy the prompt.
2. 🤖 Do as much research into the topic as hand. Writing down links to the resources.
3. 🤖 Come up with the main thesis statement or argument you want to make.
4. Create a rough outline of your essay. I like a bullet list.
5. Write the first draft, focusing only on getting your ideas down.
6. Take a break. This really does help.
7. Revise your draft for clarity and content. Check that your arguments are strong and your claims are supported by
   sources.
8. 🤖 Edit the paper for grammar, spelling, and punctuation.
    - **DO NOT USE AI TO "PARAPHRASE" WRITING**.
9. 🤖 Finally, format the entire document according to the guidelines listed above.

## How to turn it in

This is a course about AI.
This does NOT mean you can **use AI to avoid thinking.**
Abusing AI to write this paper for you is avoiding learning.
Turn into digital drop box (Blackboard).
