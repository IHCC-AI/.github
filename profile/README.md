## Install Software

We will install these together in class.
If you are lost during install SPEAK OUT, I don't want to help 20 students install this separately.
If you have questions so do others.

1. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    - A FOSS text editor/IDE
    - Make sure to enable auto save!!
        - File > Auto Save
2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/install/)
    - For Windows download the "Standalone Installer".
    - For Mac install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) THEN git via `brew install git`.
